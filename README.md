Some texture pack site I made for Geometry Dash

## How to install this locally if you want to for some reason:

1) Download and Install Node.js
2) Download or clone the repository
3) Type `npm i` to install a bunch of useless shit on your hard drive.
4) Type `cd client` in one terminal and `cd server` in another.
5) In the `client` folder type `npm run serve` to get the frontend up and running.
6) In the `server` folder also type `npm run serve` to get the backend running, if you plan on deploying this for whatever reason I would suggest running `npm run dev` so it doesn't ping it every time someone loads the page.
7) Download [MongoDBCompass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to manipulate the data made by the server. Alternatively you can use an app like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send and delete data.

(The port the server runs on is `9000` and the client port is `8080`
